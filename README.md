I’m a full-stack software engineer who thrives in dynamic environments, learning on the go and contributing to the team’s collective knowledge. I value respect and collaboration. I focus on crafting exceptional user experiences and making thoughtful architectural choices with long-term success in consideration. When I made a career switch from aviation, what attracted me to software engineering was being able to impact user experience with creative solutions which still is a driving factor for me.
